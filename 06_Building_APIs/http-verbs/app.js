// to run use curl with -X argument. by default curl sends GET requests
// curl http://localhost:3000
// curl -X POST http://localhost:3000
// curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000
// curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000

// NOTE about PATCH method/verb: the PUT method is already defined to over-write a resource with a complete new body, and cannot be reused to do partial changes. 
// PATCH allows you to partially overwrite a resource. PATCH was only formally defined in 2010, so itâ€™s relatively new on the HTTP scene
